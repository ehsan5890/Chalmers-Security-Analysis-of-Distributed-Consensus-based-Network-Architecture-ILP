# Chalmers-Security-Analysis-of-Distributed-Consensus-based-Network-Architecture-ILP
Public repo containing the ILP addressing the CDLA and CDLNA problem, both with arbitrary and non-arbitrary DCN distributions.

Personally recommend the use of Anaconda Navigator for all purposes. In such case, follow this instructions to add Gurobi to Anaconda:
